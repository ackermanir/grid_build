The following are some small changes to the game:

- Reduce archives cost to 2

- Make Trading Post better: +1 card rather than +1 buy

- Make gold rush better: the card now gives +4 gold and +2 gold at the start of next turn. The card is still applied to grid and discarded at the end of the original turn as normal.

- Change how the red (or plus action) land works. It now gives +0.5 action, +0.5 card, +0.5 gold each benefit. The effect of these should happen on the second land benefit.
