# Add buildings and effects on tech tier upgrades
When the player advances a tech tier, they can place a building on a grid tile

- A building is a permanent modifier to that grid
- Pop up a dialogue after user chooses the tech tier stating the building name and effects
- Represent a building by an emoji in that grid on the bottom left
- A card can still be played on the grid when there is a building on it
- A building is a permanent addition to that grid. Any effects persist for future card plays on that grid until game over

## Tech Tier 2 upgrade
- Place a Resource Depot üè≠ building, effects below
  - +1 additional gold
  - +1 additional card draw
  - These happen when a card with those modifiers played on grid
  - E.g. a card played which gives + 2 gold would now give +3 gold (but not an additional card draw)

## Tech Tier 3 upgrade
- Place a Refinery ‚öôÔ∏è building, effects below
  - Automatically get benefit of land on grid at beginning of turn
  - E.g. placed on a yellow grid, will get +2 gold at the beginning of each turn
- Upgrade base card effects (not a building)
  - Copper now gives +2 gold
  - Defend gets +4 defense
  - Til the land get +1 gold in addition to land benefit
- The base card upgrade changes all the card already in the players deck
- Unlocks card costing up to 10

## Tech Tier 4 upgrade
- Place a Echo Chamber üîÆ building, effects below
  - Duplicate all effects from card played on grid with building
  - This is as if the card was played twice on the same grid
  - If a card has interactive elements (e.g. archives) the effects happen successively
  - E.g. for archives player chooses cards to discard, then draws, then gets another round to discard then draw
  - E.g. if a card was +1 gold, +1 card then net effect would be +2 gold, +2 cards
